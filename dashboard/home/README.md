# Home

Clicking on the Home tab will redirect you to the Home Page of your Dashboard, which will display a summary of your existing Projects and Workspaces in the center of the screen.

From the Home Page, you can:

1. Search for existing Projects or Workspaces by name;
2. Filter through your existing Projects or Workspaces by various criteria;
3. Create a new Project, Workspace, or [Section](sections.md);

Each Project or Workspace card will contain basic information about when the Project or Workspace was created, its contents, and whether it contains any Tasks that are assigned to you.

To navigate to any Project or Workspace, simply click on it either in the center of the screen or in the lefthand sidebar.
