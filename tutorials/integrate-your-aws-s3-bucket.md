**Troubleshooting:**

For your first upload use only a few images. This will make it easier to verify that your S3 bucket is properly configured and your items list is correctly formatted. During small uploads, the existence of each file in the S3 bucket is checked. This step is skipped for large uploads for performance reasons.
