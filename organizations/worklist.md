# Worklist

The Worklist is an Organization-level record of a user's assigned and cached Tasks intended to bring clarity to several aspects of work on RedBrick AI:

* **Personal to-do list:** all of the Tasks assigned or cached to a user across all Projects, assembled in one place for ease of reference;
* **Caching state:** how many Tasks have been cached to your browser, as well as their size;
* **Task progress:** the states (i.e. Skipped, Draft, Issue, Not Started, In Progress) and Stages (i.e. Label, Review, Ground Truth) of everything in your Worklist;

Users can execute the following actions with their Worklist:

* **Open a Task in the Editor** - by clicking on the three-dot menu;
* **Navigate to Project** - by clicking on the Project name;
* **Uncache a Task** - by clicking on the **Uncache** icon next to a Task's three-dot menu;
* **Uncache a Task and remove it from Worklist** - click the Task's checkbox and select **Uncache and remove** in the snackbar that appears at the bottom of the screen. **Note:** this operation does not un-assign the Task from the currently assigned user.
* **Filter Worklist Tasks** - by Project, Stage, Task ID and Task Progress
