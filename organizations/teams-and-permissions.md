# Roles and Permissions

## Organization Permissions

You first have to invite collaborators to join your organization, _before you can invite them to your project._ When you invite collaborators to your organization, you can select their permissions. There is a single owner of each organization, and there can be unlimited Admins and Labelers.&#x20;

| Role    | What they can access                                                                                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner   | Has access to all assets within an organization, and ability create, edit, and delete assets including the organization itself.  |
| Admin   | Same permissions as an Owner, except does not have the ability to delete an organization.                                        |
| Labeler | Only able to access manual labeling and review stages. Only has access to projects, and not the data warehouse.                  |

## Project Permissions

You can invite specific users to individual projects and manage their permissions within the project.   Project permissions and teams can be managed under the **Workforce Tab** on your project dashboard. Please see the list below for information on project permissions. &#x20;

1. All Organization Admins by default are added to all projects.&#x20;
2. Admins & Owners can invite Organization Labelers to projects. By default _no labelers have access to any projects._ Labelers have to be invited to individual projects.&#x20;
3. Labelers can be assigned to specific project stages. By assigning a labeler to single or multiple stages, they will only be served tasks from those stages.&#x20;
