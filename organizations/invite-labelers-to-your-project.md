# Invite labelers to your Project

Only Admins, and Organization Owners can create projects on RedBrick AI. All admins have access to all RedBrick AI projects by default; however, Labelers have to be invited to individual projects.

You can invite labelers to projects on the **Workforce page** within your Project Dashboard. Once you have invited a labeler to a project you can **assign them to a specific stage** e.g. Review or Label. See the video below for an overview.&#x20;
