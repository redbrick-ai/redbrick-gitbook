# What Is an Organization?

Organizations are containers within which all your efforts are managed. Organizations allow your to create a workspace in which you create projects and invite team members to collaborate on your efforts. When you log into the RedBrick AI platform you will be able to create an organization, or accept an invite to an organization.

## Accepting an Organization Invite

If you have been invited to an organization, you should see the invite as soon as you log into your account. Once you accept the invite, it will be added to the list of organizations you are a part of.
