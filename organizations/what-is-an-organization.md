# What Is an Organization?

Organizations are containers within which projects, datasets, pipelines etc live. Permissions and collaboration on projects are handled within projects. When you log in to the RedBrick platform for the first time, you will be prompted to create an organization:

Once you create an organization, you will be able to invite members to collaborate with. Note by default, you will only be able to create one organization, but will be able to be a part of multiple organizations. If you wish to create more than one organization, please reach out to us at [contact@redbrickai.com](mailto:contact@redbrickai.com).

## Organization Invites

As an owner, or admin of your organization \(see [documentation on permissions](permissions.md)\), you will be able to invite your colleagues to join your RedBrick AI organization. To invite collaborators, go to organization settings page, accessible by clicking the top left of the sidebar.

Under the **Members** tab you will be able to see all the members in the current organization, as well as the permission level. Under the **Invite People** tab, you can invite a team member to collaborate, by entering the email they have used to sign up with a RedBrick AI account, and selecting their permission level.
