# Image Labeling

### Image bounding box labeling

### Image polygon labeling

### Image pixel segmentation labeling

### Image keypoints and polylines

The interface to generate and edit keypoints will work as expected - once the keypoint labeling tool is selected, click on the screen to add the keypoint label. Similarly, several clicks with the polyline tool will add a polyline - double click to end the label.
