# Bounding Box

The Bounding box entity is a representation for bounding box labels on a single datapoint. There are two sub-modules, one for each datapoint type.

### Image Bounding Box <a id="image-bounding-box"></a>

The image bounding box is an object representation for labels of a single image.

```text
redbrick.entity.label.bbox.ImageBoundingBox(labels: list)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `labels` | Labels is a object containing the labels information. The format is specified below. |

```javascript
[
  {
    "category": List[List[str]], # must match taxonomy used in the project
    "bbox2d": {
        "xnorm": float, # top left of bounding box, normalized by width of image
        "ynorm": float, # top left of bounding box, normalized by height of image
        "hnorm": float, # height of bounding box, normalized by height of image
        "wnorm": float # width of bounding box, normalized by width of image
    }
  },
  .
  .
  .
]
```

The list should contain a single entry for each bounding box in the data point.

### Video Bounding Box <a id="video-bounding-box"></a>

The video bounding box module is an object representation for labels of a single video.

```text
redbrick.entity.label.bbox.VideoBoundingBox(labels: list)
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `labels` | Labels is a object containing the labels information. The format is specified below. |

```javascript
[
  {
    "category": List[List[str]], # must match taxonomy used in the project
    "bbox2d": {
        "xnorm": float, # top left of bounding box, normalized by width of image
        "ynorm": float, # top left of bounding box, normalized by height of image
        "hnorm": float, # height of bounding box, normalized by height of image
        "wnorm": float # width of bounding box, normalized by width of image
    },
    "frameindex": int, # the index of the frame this label belongs to
    "trackid": str, # [OPTIONAL] unique track for object.
                    # Labels with same trackid are the same object
    "keyframe": bool, # [OPTIONAL] Whether this is a key frame generated,
                      # or a label generated by interpolation.
    "end": bool, # [OPTIONAL] If this is the last label for a particular
                 # object track.
  },
  .
  .
  .
]
```

The list should contain a single entry for each bounding box in the data point. The table below covers the optional keys in more detail \(read the section on [video labeling](https://docs.redbrickai.com/platform/labeling/labeling/#video-labeling) for more information\).

| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `keyframe` | `True` | When labeling a video on the RedBrick labeling interface any frame you manually edit labels on is called a _keyframe_. Labels are interpolated on every frame in between keyframes. When generating pre-labels, every label is assumed to be a keyframe. |
| `trackid` | [`uuid.uuid4()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html) | A trackid is a unique string that is the same for each individual object in a video. A single object \(say for example a car in a video\) could span several frames. Each frame would then have labels of that object with it's unique `trackid`. |
| `end` | `True` | The end field specifies whether or not this is the last occurence of a particular object in a video. When generating pre-labels, each label added is by default assumed to be a different object, therefore, the defualt value for `end` is `True` |
