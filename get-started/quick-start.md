# Quick Start

## Sign In and Create an Organization

Once you have a RedBrick account, head over to the [platform](https://app.redbrickai.com/login), and login to your account. After signing in, you will be redirected to the organizations page, where you will be prompted to create an [organization](../organizations/what-is-an-organization.md).

An organization is the container inside which all your assets \(like projects, datasets etc\) live. You can also invite people to your organization to collaborate. Once you create an organization, you will be redirected to the main application where you can begin exploring the features. 

## Create a Dataset

All projects start with data, and on the RedBrick platform, you can manage raw datasets inside the [data warehouse.](../data-warehouse-1/overview.md#datasets) Datasets are containers for your raw data - we understand the importance of data privacy and security; therefore, we have separated the notion of datasets from data storage. 

Your actual data can be stored on your own servers, or your own cloud servers like AWS S3. The RedBrick Data Warehouse will integrate with your [storage method](../data-warehouse-1/storage-methods.md), and securely import data into a dataset. Follow along with the [following guide](../data-warehouse-1/preparing-your-data.md) to prepare data for import. Once you have prepared your dataset - 

* Create your [storage method](../data-warehouse-1/storage-methods.md) to tell RedBrick AI where your data is stored. 
* [Create a dataset](../data-warehouse-1/creating.md#creating-a-dataset), and import your data using an [items list](../data-warehouse-1/preparing-your-data.md#prepare-your-items-list).

With your data now securely imported into the RedBrick Data Warehouse, you can  now interact with your data inside the dataset viewer.
