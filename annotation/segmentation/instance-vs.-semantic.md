# Instance vs. Semantic

Semantic segmentation treats multiple objects of the same class as a single entity. On the other hand, instance segmentation treats multiple objects of the same class as distinct individual objects (or instances).&#x20;

On RedBrick AI, you can **perform both semantic and instance segmentation** by controlling how many instances of a particular category you create on the left side bar. If you create more than one instance of a single category, on export, you will be able to correlate the instance ID's in your segmentation mask to your category names.&#x20;
