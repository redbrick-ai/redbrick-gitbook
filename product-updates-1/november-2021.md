# November 2021

A quick overview of the latest updates and features we've introduced to improve the overall experience while using the tool. You may want to visit the [documentation](https://docs.redbrickai.com/product-updates/july-2021-labeling-tool) if you're interested in getting a more detailed insight of these updates.



### **Labeling Tool Update - Create/Edit Mode**

The labelling tool now allows you to quickly switch between creation & edit modes while labeling. This allows for a more streamlined workflow to edit & confirm the labels before proceeding to create the next one. Some basic functionalities include:

**Creation Mode**

Selecting any labelling tool from the right toolbar or through hotkeys would activate the creation mode. While in the mode, pressing `TAB` will allow you to create new labels with the most recently used tool. The label once created would instantly become editable. To create another label, press `TAB` again or directly click on any of the labelling tools from the sidebar.



**Selection Mode**

Pressing ESC or clicking on the cursor tool from the right toolbar would activate the selection mode. While in the mode, hovering and clicking on any label will make it become editable. After editing, press ESC to switch back to the selection mode.

### MP4 Files - Direct Upload

You can now upload MP4 files directly to our servers which will be parsed to frames at the original frame rate of the video and thereby gets converted to video tasks. The upload limit includes a maximum number of 5 files per upload and a size of 50mb.

### Overview of Issues

The labelling tool allows you to create and mark certain tasks as issues. You can raise an issue on a task that either seems problematic or which are unsure how to label. An overall flow of creating an issue involves:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Group 27287.png>)

1. The labeler clicks on 'raise an issue' button placed on the top bar to open the issues modal
2. Labeler adds a description of the issue and clicks on submit which classifies the task as 'problematic', thereby sending a notification to the admin
3. The admin reviews the issue and finds a suitable resolution of either sending the task back to the labeler with a solution or re-assigning the task to another labeler
4. In the case of the task being sent back, the labeler holds the privilege of marking the created issue as 'resolved'

{% hint style="info" %}
Tasks with an ongoing issue wouldn't be editable in any form unless an admin responds and is sent back to the labeler.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
