# 3D Medical Labeling Beta

We're super excited to announce our closed beta for 3D medical labeling with DICOM support! This will allow healthcare teams to label their MRI, CT etc volume data with segmentation labels. This new update will allow teams to make use of all of RedBrick AI's project management, and automation capabilities with web based 3D medical labeling tools.&#x20;

### Multi-planar reconstruction

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Group 27341.png>)

Visualize and annotate your volumes in 3 primary planes to effectively segment your volumes. Apply a custom window level and center to help in annotating and visualizing your volumes. All this available right from your browser!

### 3D reconstruction

View your volume and segments reconstructed in 3 dimensions to get a holistic overview of your image and label volume. Increase effectiveness of your annotation review workflows through reviewing in 3D.&#x20;

### Segmentation with thresholding

You can quickly segment your volumes by making use of both manual segmentation as well as thresholding capabilities.&#x20;

### DICOM and NIFTI support

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Group 27382.png>)

Upload your DICOM series directly to RedBrick AI, or connect your external storage (AWS s3, GCP, Azure etc.) to render your data without any pre-processing. Export your annotated volumes as NIFTI files so you can work with formats you're already comfortable with.&#x20;
