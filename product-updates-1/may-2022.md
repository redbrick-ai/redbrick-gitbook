# May 2022

We're excited to update you on our revamped DICOM labeling interface. We have made upgrades to the interface and functionality of the DICOM labeling tool based on our customers feedback.&#x20;

## Revamped Interface

If you've used the previous annotation interface, you should immediately notice a difference in the entire labeling interface - fonts, icons, layout, colors etc. We've designed the interface for efficiency, and a modern/minimalistic feel.&#x20;

## A New Context Panel

The annotation tool now has a dedicated space for configuring tools and interacting with their settings - the context panel, on the right side of the labeling tool.&#x20;

The context panel will dynamically updated depending on which tools you have currently setting. Unlike before, you will now be able to select multiple tools at once, and interact with their settings all together e.g. applying thresholding and smoothing operations while segmenting a volume with a 3D brush.&#x20;

## Overlapping Segmentations

You can now create overlapping segmentations in the DICOM tool. Previously, each voxel of the volume got only 1 annotation; however, now you can add multiple annotations to a single voxel. Each segmentation tool (brush, pen etc.) will have the "overlap labels" toggle, which when activated will ensure segmentations do not get overwritten, but instead overlap.&#x20;

![In the above video, there are two overlapping segmentations. You can see the overlap clearly when both labels are being hidden/shown](<../.gitbook/assets/RedBrick AI - 23 May 2022.gif>)

## Selecting Annotation Types

There is a brand new "Create Label" button which gives you quick access to changing the kind of annotations you want to create. From the dropdown you can select "Segmentations", "Classifications" or "Landmarks".&#x20;

## Filter Your Annotation Queue

While annotating, you can now look at "All" tasks in your queue, or filter by "Skipped", "Assigned" and "Saved" tasks. You will also have a quick view of any tasks in your queue that have been failed in a review stage.&#x20;

## Edit in Review

To streamline the reviewing workflow, we have removed the extra step required to edit tasks in Review. You can now directly interact with tasks (without having to click the Edit option in Review) in the Review stage, and the changes will be tracked.&#x20;

## Select Attribute

In addition to a boolean, and text field attribute, you can now create a _Select_ attribute. The Select attribute allows annotators to choose a single options from a dropdown list.&#x20;

## ...And Much More!

As you use the annotation tool, you will notice several smaller upgrades as well. If you'd like an in-depth overview of all the changes, please reach out to us directly for a demonstration!
