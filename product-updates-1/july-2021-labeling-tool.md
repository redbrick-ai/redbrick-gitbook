# July 2021

## &#x20;New labeling tool layout

The labeling tool has a simplified layout with three main components - the sidebar for label and category details, the top bar for task level actions, and the right bar for labeling tools.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The **comments** and labeling **queue** are now on the top right of the top bar, with the **timer** visible on hover.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Updated Sidebar functionality

The sidebar now has two tabs - the **current label** section that includes information about the currently selected label, and the **all labels** section that includes information about.&#x20;

When no labels are selected, the Label Details will be empty. In this state, you can select a category from the list and interact with the canvas to **create a new label.** You can also select an existing label from the canvas, or the all labels list to **edit an existing label.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Double clicking** on a label item in the label list will take you directly to the Current label section with the label you clicked on selected.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
