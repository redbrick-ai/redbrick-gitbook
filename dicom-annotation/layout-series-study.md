# Layout - series/study

You can configure the layout of the annotation interface to display your volume(s) however you like. If your tasks has multiple series associated with it, you can visualize multiple series, along with 2D and 3D reconstructions. You can toggle the **Layout settings** on the right side of the top bar.&#x20;

In the Layout context panel, you will be able to select your view layout - you can display up to 9 volumes/reconstructions at once. When the Layout settings are toggled, you can drag and drop series/reconstructions from the context panel to construct your view ports.&#x20;

#### Using MIP

Once activated, you will not be able to paint or draw labels here, but you will be able to use this a reference visualization for annotating the main view. MIP is only available along the imaging axis (not with MPR). Use the slider on the viewport to adjust the slab thickness.&#x20;
