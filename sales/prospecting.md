# Prospecting

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is prospecting?**  
The process of finding the right people to contact, and initiating the contact process doing things like sending LinkedIn requests.
{% endhint %}

It is extremely important that we begin the sales pipeline properly, but sending connection requests to the correct persona. If we don't get connected to the correct persona, everything we do after this step will be wasted work.   
  
Check out the following page for our process of Prospecting.

## What is the correct persona?

There are two levels to reaching out to the persona we care about. First, we need to find a company that fits the market segment we are targeting, second, we need to find the right person within that company to reach out to.

### Company Persona

Watch [this google video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcycT1Jwsns) to understand what computer vision is, and the process of computer vision a little better. Visit [https://redbrickai.com](https://redbrickai.com), and the [docs](https://redbrick-ai.gitbook.io/redbrick/) to learn a little bit more about the RedBrick AI's product. A brief overview - RedBrick AI is a software platform that helps teams structure, automate, and qualify their computer vision data labeling pipelines.

So from visiting the resources above, basically you should gather that at a high level, companies that can benefit from RedBrick AI, are companies that are developing computer vision technologies e.g. self driving car companies, medical imaging, retail intelligence etc. Most companies now days will be using _deep learning_ to build these computer vision solutions. These deep learning solutions require a lot of labeled data to work, and that's where the RedBrick AI platform can help.

So long story short, teams that are using deep learning to build computer vision technologies, are the target market for us.

### Employee Persona

The person we are reaching out to needs to be aware of \(preferably personally dealt with\) the problem we are solving. Furthermore, this person needs to have the decision making power \(or easy access to someone who has\) to make a purchase. At a high level, there are two kinds of employees at companies that fit these criterion:

* Lead Engineers
* CXO's

#### Lead Engineers

Typical employee titles of the 'lead engineers' are:

* Lead Computer Vision Engineer
* Head of Computer Vision/AI
* Senior Computer Vision Engineer
* etc.

Lead engineers often have dealt with the problem first hand and have direct access to a decision maker on the team \(and sometimes can be the decision maker\). The lead engineers are often the _need decision maker -_ the person that decides if our product if filling a need or not.

#### CXO's

Typical employee titles of 'CXOs' are:

* CTO
* VP Engineer
* VP AI
* CDO \(chief data officer\)
* etc.

These people are often the _buying decision makers -_ the people that will decide whether or not they would like to buy our solution.

## Common Pitfalls

Here is a list of company personas that seem relevant at first glance but actually won't be relevant for us. 

### **3D Computer Vision**

We need to avoid teams that work _exclusively_ on 3D computer vision. Our platform/services do not support 3D data and therefore we should filter out these prospects at the start of the pipeline. 

### **Unsupervised Computer Vision**

This is very hard to tell just from looking at the company's profile, but usually comes up in the messages. If in a conversation, a person tells us that they work with _only_ unsupervised computer vision, or _only_ traditional computer vision not using deep learning/machine learning, they are incorrect persona. 

### **Deep Learning, but in NLP, audio, text, Lidar etc**. 

Our platform only supports image and video data types, and therefore we should filter out teams that work exclusively on NLP, audio, text, tabular data, Lidar.
