# Objections & Responses

**Objection 1:** _**We have an in-house team \(or\) have already outsourced our labeling efforts.**_

**Response:**

Thanks for letting me know.

I'm curious if the process is working well for you?

Many of our customers have their own internal teams or are working with an external team already. They discovered that leveraging our tool helps them in building a robust labeling process well integrated with their MLOps workflow faster without increasing their budget.

Also, these customers leverage solutions like our Active Learning system to bring upto 80% automation \( labeling processes\). I understand you already have a system in place, but would you be open to a short conversation? At the very least we could have a meaningful chat, and maybe you'll find value in what we show you.

Shall we set up something for next week?

**Objection 2:** _**It’s great, But no need for now. I will reach out to you once we need your product.**_

_**Response:**_

Thanks for the response!

Sure, we don't have to talk business right away, but we would still love to get on an exploratory call and see what you think about our solutions.

Also, we'd love to have a meaningful chat about your general training data requirements and the challenges faced. We believe this chat will be mutually beneficial when you explore this option in the future.

Let me know if you'd be open to that exploratory chat sometime this week!

**Objection 3:** _**How does your product differ from X\(competitor\)? Why should we consider RedBrick AI?**_

**Response:**

That's a great question.

Our core differentiation, is our platform is targeted to help teams build robust data labeling processes. While annotation tools and a skilled outsourced team are core parts of this offering, the true value is in the orchestration of the entire data workflow.

Our customers see an order of magnitude increase in their efficiencies just from setting up robust processes. On top of that, we offer a state of the art automated labeling \(Active Learning\) solution in partnership with Samsung SDS which has provided over 80% automation to our customers.

I'm curious if this seems relevant/of interest? Would you be open to a short conversation to discuss?

**Objection 4:** _**We deal with sensitive data / IP \(NDA\). So we can’t share them externally.**_

**Response:**

Sure, we understand the challenges with data privacy.

We have taken a number of steps to deal with this - primarily, you don't actually have to store data with RedBrick AI, we can integrate with several storage providers \(AWS S3, GCS, on-premise\) allowing you to keep full control of your data.

This is how our customers with high privacy requirements \(like healthcare teams\) use our platform.

Here is a quick overview of the data model and how it ensures the privacy of your data - [https://docs.redbrickai.com/projects/importing-data](https://docs.redbrickai.com/projects/importing-data)

Could we connect over a quick demo to identify how our product can fit your use cases?

How does your calendar look for this Thursday or Friday afternoon?

**Objection 5:** _**Send me your information. I’ll pass it along to my team.**_

**Response:**

Absolutely! I’ll be sharing our product information shortly for your perusal.

Shall we also set up a quick discussion later next week to understand your team's thoughts and showcase our product demo to see it in action?

**Objection 6:** _**We don’t have a budget/plan to buy this Quarter. Touch base in 3 months.**_

**Response:** 

Thanks for your response. Certainly understand that.

Besides the price, is there anything else you have concerns about?

We have different plans and pricing models that may fit into your budget. If pricing is the only concern, we can have a discussion to work it out.

Shall we do a quick meeting later this week or next week to showcase the product demo and discuss the pricing?

**Objection 7:** _**We are not interested.**_

**Response:**

Thanks for letting me know. I respect your opinion. If you don't mind me asking, is this not of interest because:

1. Your team isn't building training datasets.
2. This is a problem you've spent a lot of time figuring out and have a robust solution in place.
3. This is bad timing.
4. Can’t make decisions by yourself and ****are unsure other stakeholders will consider this.

Your response is really appreciated to close this loop!. Appreciate a response!
