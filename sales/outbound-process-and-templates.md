# Outbound Process and Templates

## Prospecting \(Sending Connections\)

1. Open LinkedIn Sales Navigator using the account you are assigned to. 
2. Apply the relevant filters for the persona we are targeting \(go through the correct [personas](prospecting.md#what-is-the-correct-persona) for reference\). A typical search looks like this:
   1. Enter keywords in the search for an exact string match - "computer vision".
   2. Select the targeted geographical areas - "North America", "Asia" etc. 
   3. Select the company headcount/size - usually all the companies between 10 to 10,000 works
   4. Remove leads that you've already saved or reached out to. 
3. Identify a relevant company by seeing if the employ computer vision engineers. Once you have found a[ relevant company](prospecting.md#company-persona), visit their LinkedIn sales navigator page. Within the employees list, look for the [Lead Engineers, and CXO personas](prospecting.md#employee-persona). 
4. While sending connection request to someone you could also do the following to find more prospects easily: 

   1. Look at the previous experience of the prospect. You'll probably find more companies that use computer vision.

## Sending Messages \(Lead Generation\)

The entire process of sending messages right now consists of cold messaging and then doing **three follow-ups** with an interval of at least **3 days.** 

### Sending the first message

1. Open the "Connections" page from the homepage of LinkedIn, it should be on the left under the profile photo. 
2. Refer to the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HIU79tbR2qKaJlVwaPyZX6_Uja08K02o6L3jEkd27X4/edit?ts=5f22bb5f#gid=0) to check who was the last person a message was sent to. 
3. Start sending the first message continuing from where it was left \(preferably start from the bottom and move upwards because that way you won't miss people in between\). 
4. Update the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HIU79tbR2qKaJlVwaPyZX6_Uja08K02o6L3jEkd27X4/edit?ts=5f22bb5f#gid=0):
   1. Fill in the the name and other details of the person. 
   2. If the cell having the name turns DARK GRAY, it means we’ve already sent an email to someone with the same name:
      1. Use the Find feature \(`ctrl+F`\) inside the sheet to look at other people with the same name
      2. Check if the person you’re messaging right now is different and is not being re-messaged 
   3. If the entire row turns **GRAY**, it means that either the company is already on a demo, and therefore **do not message them.** 
   4. Now if we haven’t messaged the person before \(**Step 2**\) and if the row doesn’t turn Grey \(**Step 3**\) on entering the name of the company, that means that we're good to reach out to the person. 
5. Copy and paste the template \(attached below\) replacing the parameters in italics according to the information on the prospect's profile and send the first message.

### Sending the follow ups

1. Open the profiles with the status _sent_ in the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HIU79tbR2qKaJlVwaPyZX6_Uja08K02o6L3jEkd27X4/edit?ts=5f22bb5f#gid=0) ****and if the person has not replied to the first message, copy paste the **follow up 1** template and send it after changing the parameters in the template. Update the status as _followup_. 
2.  If the status is _followup_ and if the person hasn't replied yet, then do the same but use the **follow up 2 template** and update the status  as _f2._ 
3. If the status is _f2_ and if the person hasn't replied yet, then do the same using **follow up 3 template** and update the Status at _f3._

**Introductory message**  
  
Hi _&lt;first name&gt;_,

I’m reaching out to you because I'm trying to learn more about the challenges teams face in creating and managing vision training data. As a _&lt;position&gt;_ at _&lt;company name&gt;_, I thought you would be the right person to talk to about this \(if not, could you direct me to the right person?\).

Have you and your team figured out a process that works well - do you manage all labeling and data management efforts in house?

Hi _&lt;first name&gt;_,

I trust that you have had an opportunity to read my previous message, so I figured it’d be worth checking in with you again. I’m the co-founder of RedBrick AI \(https://redbrickai.com\), which is a software platform for creating and managing vision training data. 

Teams use the platform to structure, automate and qualify their labeling efforts. From your profile, it looked like you might be involved in this effort at _&lt;company name&gt;_.

Is this something your team manages in-house with custom-built tools? If yes, has this process worked well?

Regards,

## Email Templates

{% hint style="success" %}
**First Email**

**Skeleton**:

Hi \_\_\_\_\_\_,

**Email hook**- Based on our own research on the company and prospect. For example, if the prospect has spoken about something in a conference/article that is relevant to what we do.   
  
Alternatively, it can be a generic hook regarding a common pain-point that prospect's industry faces with regards to data labelling etc.  
  
**Main Body**- Brief introduction of Redbrick and how it can be useful to address the pain point \(mentioned in the hook\).  
  
**Call to action**- Close ended action statement- asking prospect for a time slot for product demo/ sharing calendar link. Define clear cut timelines.

**Template Example\(for a healthcare CXO\)**:  
  
Hi XYZ,  
  
In a time when the healthcare sector is already under a lot of strain, medical image labelling gains even more importance. Labelling process usually involves a lot of man hours and money and the resources that we save here can be better used elsewhere.  
  
This is where we at Redbrick AI come in. RedBrick AI is a software platform for creating and managing computer vision training data. Our current clients use the platform to structure, automate and qualify their labeling efforts in a collaborative way. With Redbrick AI's platform you can perform your labelling process much faster and in a much more cost effective manner.  
  
I would be glad to showcase our offering to you and show you how we accomplish this process. Let's connect on a quick 30 mins call sometime this week or next week. Feel free to book a slot on my calendar.  
  
Regards,  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Follow up email \(based on 'structure' use case\):**  
  
Hi XYZ,  
  
I hope you had a chance to review my prevous email. I wanted to touch base with you regarding some of the use cases that we solve for our current clients.  
  
One of those use cases is to structure, customize and manage your data labelling workflows with robust pipelines. The Redbrick AI platform enabes you to maintain deep insights and helps you to track exactly what happens to all your data throughout the lifecycle of your project and fix issues sooner rather than later. You can also control your data access but storing your data on Redbrick or integrate your current storage method with Redbrick AI warehouse.   
  
The screenshot below should help you understand this feature.  
  
\[Attach relevant screenshot\]  
  
We have more features that help you not only structure your workflows, but also cover any other use cases and pain points that you might currently have in your data labelling process.  
  
I would be glad to give you a demo of our platform over a short  30 minuntes call some time this week or next week. Let me know a convenient time slot or book a slot on your own on my calendar. Looking forward to our conversation.  
  
Regards,  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Followup email\(based on 'automate' use case\)**:  
  
  
Hi XYZ,  
  
One of the most common problem our current clients used to face was the amount of time it took them to label the data manually. Through our partnership with Samsung, Redbrick enables you to save 80% of your time that you would otherwise spend labelling your data.   
  
You only have to label a small portion of your dataset, and train Samsung SDS AutoLabel to automatically label the rest of your data. Whether it's you'r own model, or AutoLabel, you can build iterative human-in-the-loop workflows to automate labeling and shorten the feedback loop between model training and human labeling.  
  
\[Attach screenshot\]  
  
We have several more features that will help you save time and human resources on a large scale. I would be glad to show you these features and much more over a short 30 mins call. Let me know of a convenient time slot and I will share an invite accordingly. Alternatively, feel free to book a slot on my calendar. Looking forward to our conversation.  
  
Regards,
