# Lead Generation

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is lead generation?**  
Sending introductory messages, and a series of follow up messages to generate interest in a prospect. Also includes the LinkedIn conversations \(followups\) that take place after a prospect replies to the intro/followup messages.
{% endhint %}

Check out the following page for our process of lead generation. 

{% page-ref page="outbound-process-and-templates.md" %}

## Process

Equally as important to prospecting is lead generation. This is the process of actually getting someone interested in our product. Our current process is:

1. Intro cold message 
2. _3 cold followups_ if the person doesn't respond. After these 4 messages, we can move on from this prospect for the time being. [Here are the templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqvL6IPWfRtnJGvFlp7HMZq-4dAMTTKf4OQw87ViCPI/edit) for the messages. 
3. Carry out a conversation with anyone who responds. If the person is relevant, and we want to make sure to continue following up with them, add them to the `followup` column in Notion, and assign to `Shivam Sharma` if you want me to respond to them. After the initial conversation, if we don't get replies for 4 messages, we should move on from the prospect for the time being.  If a prospect displays interest at any time, add them to the `interested` section on Notion, and set a followup date and assign the relevant person. For all the genuinely `interested` people, we should followup _until we get a yes or no from them._ 
4. Some of the interested prospects will agree to a product demo, these people are now _leads._ When a lead confirms a demo date and time, add them to the `demo` section on Notion.

## Common Rejections/Replies

Some common replies/rejections and how to deal with them are covered below. **Keep in mind these are just guidelines, the most value comes from customized messages for each lead/prospect. Try and understand the situation they are in, and piece together a story that will be compelling for them**.

## We don't deal with vision/image/video data, we only work with tabular/nlp/audio \(etc.\) data

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is incorrect persona, so should drop this prospect
{% endhint %}

Okay thanks for letting me know, if you ever do move to the computer vision domain let me know!

## We have an in-house tool/use open source tools to solve this problem.

Thanks for your response! Okay got it, if you don't mind me asking, how well has this process worked for you and your team?

Teams use RedBrick AI to structure, automate, and qualify their labeling pipelines. The platform also offers several tools to enable quicker labeling, seamless collaboration on your training data assets, and tools to track and trace issues throughout the lifecycle of the project.

I understand that you have processes in place already, but i'm curious if any of this seems relevant/of interest to you?

{% hint style="info" %}
You can choose to add a different call to action depending on the situation
{% endhint %}

## We are looking to outsource the annotation process.

Thanks for the response! Okay got it. We have partners with 400+ full time labelers, and quality assurance experts that through the RedBrick platform are able to deliver high-quality labels.

In the past we have worked with teams who have used RedBrick AI with their own/our/other external workforces to enable better collaboration and tracking through our workforce insights. You can configure your pipeline to involve multiple stakeholders in the annotation process and even involve a pre-trained model \(human-in-the-loop style\) to accelerate your workflows.

{% hint style="info" %}
Add a call to action - set a time for talking/demo etc. 
{% endhint %}

## This seems interesting, but it's bad timing right now.

Thanks for letting me know, please feel free to reach out to me anytime you feel like timing is better. We'd be happy to give you a quick product overview and demonstrate how you can use RedBrick AI to structure, automate and qualify your labeling pipelines.

{% hint style="info" %}
These ones are a little tricky, because if pushed we could probably get them on a demo, but there's no point in the demo if they're not open to even buying right now.   
  
So the strategy is to suggest a demo when the **timing is right.**
{% endhint %}

## I'm not the right person to chat with / I can't make the decision.

{% hint style="warning" %}
No point pushing this person for a demo, because most they could do is give product feedback, and won't actually be able to push the sale forward.   
  
What we want from these people is for them to connect us to someone relevant. Should follow up with them to get connected to a relevant person. 
{% endhint %}

Okay got it, thanks for letting me know. Is there someone that you could direct me to that would be the right person to chat with?

## I can't talk about this \(NDA\), why do you want to know about this?

Hi, okay I understand. I was curious to learn more about the challenges you and your team face in managing your data labeling processes.   
  
I'm the co-founder of RedBrick AI \(https://redbrickai.com\), which is a software platform that team use to structure, automate, and qualify their labeling pipelines.   
  
If you had the chance to visit our website, i'm curious if this seems relevant/interesting.

## We handle it in-house, no need for external help right now.

Thanks for your response! Okay got it, if that ever changes or the timing is better in the future please feel free to reach out to me.   
  
Till then, i'm attaching a short PDF overview of the platform, and would be happy anytime to give a quick product demo and demonstrate how teams use RedBrick to structure, automate, and qualify their labeling efforts. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Attach the [PDF overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XY7SAavBzW63tJjMV_6Xh1uM2jOFwtuH/view?usp=sharing) of the platform.
