# Conversion

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is Conversion?**  
Conversion entails all steps of taking an interested lead to a paying customer. At a high level, this involves a product demonstration, post-demo calls, a trial and finally conversion to customer. 
{% endhint %}

## Product Demonstration

Structure the product demonstration as follows: 

1. **Preliminaries:** Pre-selling, introductions etc. 
2. **Investigating:** Asking questions, learning.
3. **Demonstration:** Showcasing the solution.
4. **Commitment:** Advancing the sale. 

### Investigating

Investigating is probably the most important step in the product demonstration, and here's the framework to follow \(SPIN\):

#### Situation

Understand the spot the prospect better.

* What kind of computer vision related work do you?
* How do you label data, and how do you manage your labeling pipeline?
* What kind of data / labels do you work with?
* In-house vs. outsourced?

#### Problem

Uncover, or help them uncover the problem they are facing

* Is collaboration between all stakeholders working well?
* Are you able to leverage automation at all / easily?
* Is your workflow ad-hoc / is project management messy?
* What is your biggest pain point in labeling data, and managing the process?

#### Implication

What implications do the problems they're facing have? 

* Is your team happy with the quality of data / labels it is producing? What about volume?
* Do you feel like your team wastes time in project managing the process?
* Are you able to iterate on your projects as fast as you like?

#### Need - Payoff

What is their product need? What solution will address their needs. 

* If you're able to improve collaboration and project management in labeling projects - through a central platform/hub, will it add value?
* If you are able to approach your labeling in a human-in-the-loop fashion, will it add value?
